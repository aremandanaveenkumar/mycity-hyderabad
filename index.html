                <h3>History</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Hyderabad is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Telangana. It occupies 650 km2 (250
                    sq mi) on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of Southern
                    India. With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain
                    around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake. According to the 2011 census of India,
                    Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of 6.9 million residents
                    within the city limits, and has a population of 9.7 million residents in the metropolitan region,
                    making it the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in India.</p>

                <h3>Geography</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Hyderabad is 1,566 km (973 mi) south of Delhi, 699 km (434 mi) southeast of Mumbai, and 570 km (350
                    mi) north of Bangalore by road. The original city of Hyderabad was founded on the banks of river
                    Musi and has grown over centuries on the both banks of the river. Now known as the historic "Old
                    City", home to the Charminar and Mecca Masjid, it lies on the southern bank of the river. The city
                    center saw a shift to the north of the river, with the construction of many government buildings and
                    landmarks. Hyderabad and Secunderabad are called as 'Twin cities' as they are closely linked with
                    each other. A man made lake, known as the Hussain Sagar Lake, separates the two cities. The rapid
                    growth of the city, along with the growth of Secunderabad and neighboring municipalities has
                    resulted in a large and populous metropolitan area.</p>

                <h3>Climate</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The climate of Hyderabad remains fairly warm through most parts of the year and does not receive much
                    rainfall in the monsoon. With the onset of winters in North and central parts of India, temperatures
                    marginally come down in the months of December and January and the nights become quite cool in and
                    around the Hyderabad city. During the summer months, the mercury goes as high as 42 °C while in
                    winters the minimum temperature may come down to as low as 12 °C. June to November are the months of
                    monsoons, accompanied by rains. During the Monsoons also the temperature goes down at times. </p>

                <p>Thus, for most parts of the year the weather and climate of Hyderabad remains fairly moderate and you
                    can visit the Hyderabad city anytime in the year but the best season to visit Hyderabad is between
                    October–February.</p>
