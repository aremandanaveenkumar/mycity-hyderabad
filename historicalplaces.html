                            Once the seat of the Asaf Jahi Dynasty, the Chowmahalla Palace was built in Hyderabad. This
                            historical place in Hyderabad is located near the famous monument, Charminar and Laad Bazar.
                            The palace is designed very intricately and holds that Nawabi Charm in itself.

                            Charminar is the most important historical place in Hyderabad. The monument was erected when
                            Quli Qutb Shah shifted his capital from Golcondo to Hyderabad. The monument got its name
                            from its structure as it consists of four minarets. The monument looks amazing during night
                            when it is illuminated.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            One of the oldest monuments in the city, Qutub Shahi Tombs were built by Sultan Quli. The
                            tombs are located in Ibrahim Bagh and are approximately 850 meters away from Banjara Darwaza
                            of Golconda fort. These complexes are either one story or two storied and have mosques and
                            tombs of kings of Qutub Shahi Dynasty. What’s interesting is that an inscribed sarcophagus
                            covers the actual burial vault at the center of each tomb. The domes originally had
                            beautiful blue-green tile work, but only a few pieces remain as evidence to this fact. The
                            structure of the tombs is influenced by Persian, Pathan, Deccan and Hindu styles.

                        <p>
                            With the capacity of hosting 10,000 people, Makkah Masjid is the largest mosque in India. It
                            was built in the 17th century and takes the name from the Grand Mosque of Mecca. The bricks
                            used in the central archway of the structure are made from the soil sourced from Mecca. It
                            is said that around 8000 masons worked round the clock to complete the construction in 77
                            years. The three fascinating and exquisitely designed facades are carved out of a single
                            granite stone which took the large team of workers five years to quarry. This structure was
                            comprehensively designed and has floral motifs and friezes with cornices running around the
                            entire mosque’s complex. The courtyard entrance is home to the Asaf Jah ruler’s marble
                            gravesite.

                    <h3>Taramati Baradari</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Situated on a hilltop, Taramati Baradari is believed to be built in honor of Abdullah Qutb
                            Shah’s favorite courtesan Taramati. It is a Persian-style constructed garden and a
                            historical Sarai having 12 doorways. It was considered an engineering genius because the
                            doors allowed cross ventilation, which was something unique at that point in time. Many
                            stories suggest that the structure was built so that Abdullah Qutb Shah could hear the
                            enchanting voice as Taramati sang for the travelers staying at the Sarai, while another tale
                            hints that two dancing sisters, Taramati and Premamati would dance on the ropes tied between
                            the balcony of the king and the Sarai. Taramati Baradari has excellent acoustics, and
                            because Taramati dedicated her life to dance and music, several classical music and dance
                            performances are held at the palace. There’s a large open theater in the complex with the
                            capacity of 1600 people.
